git init - initialaize repository
rm -rf .git / if I want to stop traking this local directory with git
git ls-files - show all the files in the staging area
git status
git status -s     get the status with shortcuts : M modified, ?? untracked

git log / gives us the hash code of the commits
git log --oneline - shows the log in a nice one line view

git commit -m "message to commit"  - commit the staging area to the repository
git commit -a -m "message" - adding to stage all file and commiting in one git command
git add filename1  - add file to the staging area
git rm file1.txt - remove the file from the working directory and the staging area
git rm --cache filename - remove the file only from the staging area
git diff --staged  - view the staging area before commit to repository (only staged changes)
git diff - view the changes between files in the working dir to the files in the staging area
git diff HEAD -lists all changes in the working directory since your last commit ( staged and unstaged )
git diff branch1..branch2 
git add -A  / add all file to the staging area
git reset / remove all the file from the staging area
git branch  - shows all the current branches (the branch that we are now working on will be sign with'*')
git branch -a // name all the branches of the repository
git clone <url to of the repo> <the dir to clone it to>
git pull // pull the changes made by others since the last time we pulled
git config --global user.email "eranka@checkpoint.com"
git config --global user.name "eran kamil"
git config --list  / to check the details like email and name
The gitignore file its a file that we add to it files we want git to ignore

git branch <name of the brach to create>
git branch -d <name of brach>  - deleting the branch
git branch -D <name of brach>  - force deleting the branch
git branch -M <my_new_name> (to rename you have to be on that branch)
git branch -r  ( list of all the remote branches , in clone we by default cloning the main branch but we can switch to athor remote branch with git switch)
git checkout <name of brach> / switch to this branch
git checkout <hash number of a commit> - move our HEAD to point on some commit we made - DETACH HEAD! (like going back in time)
git checkout HEAD~<number> - move our HEAD to point on some commit we made - DETACH HEAD! (like going back in time) , example: git checkout HEAD~1 (point to one commit berfore the HEAD)
   How to attch the HEAD back ?
      1) switch back to our branch  - git switch -
      2) create a new branch from the commit we were back to 
git checkout HEAD <filename> - discarding the current changes to what HEAD points on (the last commit)
git restore <filename>  - same result as git checkout HEAD <filename> 
git restore --source HEAD~<number> <file_name> - to revert <number> commits before HEAD

Unstaging files:
git restore --staged <file_name>

git reset <commit-hash> - will reset a repo back to the commit been given . but its keep our changes in the working dir (good reason to use: committed to unwanted branch)
git rest --hard commit-hash> - hard reset , will lost also the changes in the working dir

git revert <commit-hast> - It use to discard changes like reset and checkout but the difference that he make new commit and not deleting the bad commits (must secure option)

git switch <name of brach>  - switching to the branch , this is the newest way to do it . NOT with checkout
git switch -c <branch-name> - creating and switching to the new branch

git push origin branch_name // push branch to remote with the same name of branch , if not exist create one on the remote side
git push origin --delete test_branc / delete the brach from the remote repo
git push origin master // push master branch to the remote repo
git push origin local_branch_name:remote_branch_name  // if we want to push x to y and not x to x like by default

HEAD -> branch_name , HEAD is a pointer to a branch. the branch that we are now working on.

Stashing 
 Git provieds an east way to stashing there uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later! without making unnecessary commits.

git stash - save the uncommitted changes to the stashing area
git stash pop  - the  uncommitted changes poped from the stash to our current branch
git stash apply - the  uncommitted changes poped from the stash but stays there and we can apply then in more branches
git stash list - shows the list of the stashed in the Stack
git stash frop <stash-id> - drop this stash form the Stack

Rebasing
 Two main ways to use git rebase command:
 1) as an alternative to merging
 2) as a cleanup tool

=========================
Working with GITHUB
=========================

1) method 1 is that we have source code locally and we want to store it in github
	1. Make new repo in github
	2. git remote add origin <url_from_github_repo> // origin can be other name we want
	3. git branch -M main // rename the mater to be main , not must
	3. git push <remote> <branch_name> // remote is origin useally . for exmaple: push origin main

2) Start from scracth:
	1. Create brand new repo in github
	2. clone it down to your machine , git clone <url>

git fetch <remote> - get all new changes in the remote repository and get access to them but thet are not NOT getting into our working dir  
git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>  (a shorter version is : git pull )- similiar to git fetch , it is update also our working directory with the lated changes. PULL == FETCH + MERGE

patch -p1 < patchfile.patch // add the patch to the local module

git -c http.sslVerify=false  clone <url_to_clone_from>
git -c http.sslVerify=false https://github.com/Colt/yesterday-exercise

git config --global http.sslCAInfo C:/Users/eranka/Desktop/ca-bundle.crt
